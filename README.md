# tic-tac-toe

This game is for the Tic-Tac-Toe project within The Odin Project which can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-tic-tac-toe 

## Technology Used
This project was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## Skills worked on
I am working on the module pattern to create this project, encapsulating functions within the following modules:
* gameBoard
    * this module handles all functions related to manipulating and reading the board
* gameController
    * this module handles the flow of the game itself
* Cell
    * this module sets and gets the value within a cell
* screenController
    * this module handles the DOM manipulation
